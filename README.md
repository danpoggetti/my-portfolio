# my-portfolio

## Description
This project was to build a portfolio without starter code. The point of a portfolio is to showcase skills and talents to potential employers in hopes to stand apart from your peers or competition. A portfolio makes an excellent resource to house all of your current and future projects. I first outlined the HTML on paper for how I wanted my portfolio to look. I then found the colors I wanted to impletement in the header, body, font, h1, h2, etc. I ultimately added the CSS and made numerous revisions until my portfolio resembeled my vision.

## Credit
For color inspiration, I used Google to search for pleasing, pretty and masculine complementary colors. I found an article called "33 beautiful color combinations for your next design" on the website 99designs.com. The color inspiration I used was Navy, almond and red-orange.
